### POC Implementation for 2D raster image and vector shapes using Fabric JS  

### Fabric.js: 

Best suited for handling both raster (image) and vector (shape) graphics on 	HTML5 canvas. 
Provides extensive tools for creating, manipulating, and annotating images. 
Supports interactive objects, allowing users to move, resize, and edit annotations. 

## Fabric.js version:
Fabric JS Latest Version â€“ 6.5.4 can directly use the shapes that is already in 
place for Fabric library (i.e. Canvas, Rect, Circle, Textbox, PencilBrush,Image) 

Capabilities that are involved in this POC 

2D Image Upload
1. Upload a jpg/Png file into the canvas. Able to Resize/Rotate/Crop the Image. 
2. Editing a Text into a canvas.  
3. Adding Filters with different visuals that will be reflected in an image 
4. Able to download the edited image from canvas. 
5. Added Free hand drawing (pencil brush) to point out in an image.
